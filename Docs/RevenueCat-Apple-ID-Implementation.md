# RevenueCat Apple ID-Based Subscription System

## Overview
This document outlines the complete rebuild of the Mariner Studio subscription system to solve critical cross-device restoration issues using RevenueCat with Apple ID-based user identification.

## Problem Statement
The original implementation suffered from:
- Anonymous users getting different RevenueCat IDs on different devices
- Failed cross-device subscription restoration 
- Users forced to repurchase subscriptions on each device
- Non-compliance with Apple's expected subscription behavior

## Solution Architecture

### Core Principle: Apple ID-Based User Identification
Instead of relying on purely anonymous RevenueCat IDs, we now use a stable identifier based on the user's Apple ID, ensuring the same user gets the same RevenueCat App User ID across all their devices.

### Key Components

#### 1. AppleIDRevenueCatService (`/Services/AppleIDRevenueCatService.swift`)
**Purpose**: Manages RevenueCat user identification using Apple ID-based stable identifiers

**Key Features**:
- Generates consistent App User IDs across devices for the same Apple ID
- Handles cross-device subscription restoration automatically
- Provides privacy-friendly Apple ID hashing
- Falls back to device-specific stable IDs when Apple ID unavailable
- Integrates with Keychain for secure ID storage

**Core Methods**:
```swift
// Get stable App User ID based on Apple ID
func getStableAppUserID() async -> String

// Configure RevenueCat with Apple ID identification  
func configureRevenueCatWithAppleID(apiKey: String) async

// Restore purchases with Apple ID support
func restorePurchasesWithAppleIDSupport() async throws -> CustomerInfo
```

#### 2. Updated AppDelegate (`/RevenueCat/AppDelegateAdaptor.swift`)
**Changes**:
- Now uses `AppleIDRevenueCatService` for configuration
- Configures RevenueCat with stable App User ID instead of anonymous
- Improved logging for Apple ID-based identification

#### 3. Enhanced Views (`ContentView.swift`, `MainView.swift`)
**Changes**:
- Integration with `AppleIDRevenueCatService`
- Updated restore flows to use Apple ID-based restoration
- Enhanced logging for debugging Apple ID functionality

## How It Works

### 1. App Launch Flow
```
1. App starts → AppDelegate.didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()
2. AppleIDRevenueCatService.getStableAppUserID() called
3. Service checks Keychain for cached Apple ID hash
4. If not found, attempts to extract from App Store receipt
5. Falls back to device-specific stable ID if needed
6. RevenueCat configured with stable App User ID
7. User can make purchases/restore with consistent identity
```

### 2. Cross-Device Restoration Flow
```
1. User opens app on new device
2. Same Apple ID → Same stable App User ID generated
3. User triggers restore purchases
4. AppleIDRevenueCatService.restorePurchasesWithAppleIDSupport() called
5. Service ensures correct Apple ID identification
6. RevenueCat restores purchases to correct user ID
7. Subscriptions accessible across all devices
```

### 3. User Identification Strategy
```
Priority Order:
1. Cached Apple ID hash (from Keychain)
2. Apple ID extracted from App Store receipt  
3. Device-specific stable identifier (fallback)

Format: "apple_[SHA256_HASH]" or "device_[SHA256_HASH]"
```

## RevenueCat Dashboard Configuration

### Required Settings
1. **Restore Behavior**: Set to "Transfer to New App User ID" (Default)
   - Location: RevenueCat Dashboard → Project Settings → Restore Behavior
   - This allows purchases to transfer between App User IDs when restoring
   - Critical for proper Apple ID-based restoration

2. **Entitlements**: Ensure "Pro" entitlement is properly configured
   - Map subscription products to "Pro" entitlement
   - Verify product IDs match App Store Connect configuration

3. **Webhooks** (Optional): Configure for server-side subscription tracking
   - Enable relevant events (purchase, renewal, cancellation)
   - Handle transfer events for cross-device scenarios

## Apple Store Connect Requirements

### 1. In-App Purchase Products
- Ensure subscription products are active
- Product IDs must match RevenueCat configuration
- Test with Sandbox environment first

### 2. App Store Review Guidelines Compliance
- ✅ Restore purchases functionality implemented
- ✅ No mandatory account creation for subscriptions  
- ✅ Cross-device subscription access supported
- ✅ Proper subscription management flow

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Single Device Testing
```
1. Fresh app install
2. Purchase subscription
3. Delete and reinstall app
4. Restore purchases → Should work
```

### 2. Cross-Device Testing
```
1. Device A: Install app, purchase subscription
2. Device B: Install app with same Apple ID
3. Device B: Trigger restore purchases
4. Verify subscription access on Device B
```

### 3. Edge Cases
```
1. Airplane mode during restoration
2. Apple ID changes between devices
3. App Store receipt validation failures
4. Keychain data corruption
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Key Log Categories
- `APPLE_ID_SERVICE`: Apple ID identification processes
- `REVENUECAT_INIT`: RevenueCat configuration and setup
- `SUBSCRIPTION`: Purchase and restoration flows

### Critical Metrics to Monitor
1. Restore success rate across devices
2. Anonymous vs identified user ratios
3. Cross-device subscription activation times
4. Failed restoration error patterns

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Monitor Apple ID service logs
grep "APPLE_ID_SERVICE" DebugConsole.log

# Check RevenueCat configuration
grep "REVENUECAT_INIT" DebugConsole.log

# Track subscription flows
grep "SUBSCRIPTION" DebugConsole.log
```

## Migration from Old System

### For Existing Users
1. **Automatic Migration**: Existing users will be migrated to Apple ID-based identification on first app launch after update
2. **Restore Required**: Users may need to trigger restore purchases once to link existing subscriptions
3. **No Data Loss**: All existing subscriptions will be preserved

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Stage 1**: Deploy to TestFlight with limited testers
2. **Stage 2**: A/B test with subset of production users  
3. **Stage 3**: Full rollout after validation
4. **Stage 4**: Monitor metrics and adjust as needed

## Security Considerations

### Privacy Protection
- Apple ID never stored in plain text
- SHA256 hashing ensures one-way transformation
- Keychain storage for sensitive identifiers
- Compliance with Apple's privacy guidelines

### Data Protection
- All user identification happens locally
- No Apple ID data transmitted to third parties
- RevenueCat only receives hashed identifiers
- User can still use app without account creation

## Benefits of New Implementation

### For Users
- ✅ Subscriptions work seamlessly across all devices
- ✅ No need to create accounts for subscription access
- ✅ Restore purchases works reliably
- ✅ Apple-standard subscription experience

### For Developers  
- ✅ Reduced support tickets for restoration issues
- ✅ Improved subscription retention metrics
- ✅ Compliance with Apple guidelines
- ✅ Better revenue tracking across devices

### For Business
- ✅ Higher user satisfaction
- ✅ Reduced churn from restoration failures
- ✅ Improved conversion rates
- ✅ Better subscription analytics
