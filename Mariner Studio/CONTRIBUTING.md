# Contributing Guidelines for Mariner Studio

This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the Mariner Studio project and the preferred workflow for collaborating with AI assistants like Claude.

## Planning Before Implementation

**IMPORTANT**: Before implementing any code changes, provide:

1. A clear plan of action outlining the approach
2. An ordered list of files that will need to be:
   - Created
   - Modified

This allows for review of the approach before any actual implementation work begins.

## Implementation Process

After the plan has been reviewed and approved:

1. Implement changes according to the agreed-upon plan
2. Explain key decisions or non-obvious implementation details
3. Note any deviations from the original plan and the reasons for them

## Code Style

- Follow Swift style guidelines and existing project conventions
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Include documentation comments for public interfaces
- Match the existing indentation and formatting patterns

## Error Handling

- Use Swift's error handling patterns consistently
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Consider failure cases and edge conditions

## Testing

- Consider testability when designing new features
- Describe how new code can be tested

## Communication

- Be explicit about assumptions
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Highlight potential issues or trade-offs in proposed solutions

This document may be updated as the project evolves.
